This is simply a typescript translation of a youtube web series.

All credit to the original author, thank you.

### What is this

Following along with this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-FpDQ8Eqw8&list=PLS8HfBXv9ZWWe8zXrViYbIM2Hhylx8DZx), using typescript, to explore game dev concepts with vanilla js.

For the life of me I dunno what the ideal configuration would be for writing in typescript for browser without a bundler like webpack.  What I have used here has its quirks; namely that I have to add .js extension in all import statements. On the plus side no bundler!?

### Trying this out

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run start
```
